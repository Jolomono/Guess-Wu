# Guess-Wu
Can you identify members of the Wu-Tang Clan?

A 5 Round Quiz Game where you try to identify members of the Wu Tang Clan 
(and a few surprise guests) by appearance and audio clips.

This game was created by modifying the simple Mario-style platformer from the 
CS50X Harvard Online course here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/. 
I've kept the sprite sheet and character animations from that game but changed 
nearly everything else. The game from that course was a 2d side scrolling 
tile-based platformer. I overhauled it into a 2d overhead map game with 
random rapper placement, sound files, difficulty options, and title/result screens.

This game is written in LUA and uses the LÃ–VE 2D gaming engine (Version 11.3) which is 
available for free here: https://love2d.org/
