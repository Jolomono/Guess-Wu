# Guess-Wu
Can you identify members of the Wu-Tang Clan?

This game is written in LUA and uses the LÃ–VE 2D gaming engine which is 
available for free here: https://love2d.org/

This game was created by modifying the simple Mario-style platformer from the 
CS50X Harvard Online course here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/. 
I've kept the sprite sheet and character animations from that game but changed 
nearly everything else. The game from that course was a 2d side scrolling 
tile-based platformer and I overhauled it into a 2d overhead map game with 
random rapper placement, sound files, and a result screen. 

To run this game, drag the entire "Guess-Wu" folder onto the LOVE icon and it 
will launch.
